                <p>When you seek out a designer for your new home plan, you are expecting something special, something unique that is appealing both aesthetically and functionally.  At Studio Boise, we love to solve your unique challenges with creative design..</p>
                <p>This renovated space had an ugly, poorly surfaced wall in built long ago to house the retrofitted lighting and receptacles.  Rather than pull down the wall and re-surface it with drywall, we elected to cover it in crumpled paper making a fun art project for the family and an incredible design statement.</p>
                <p>In this small East End Boise home, there will not be enough space for a guest room in the new floor plan.  However, since guests are a rarity for this family, a portion of the small office will be a built in reading nook with a full sized mattress.  When the occasional guest does come to stay, this office converts into a cozy guest space with built in drawers underneath the nook for their storage.</p>
                <p>If you can open yourself up to the idea of combining functions, or embracing a quirky feature, your new house plan can delight you with innovative solutions.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Working From Home</h2>
                <p>During this time of social distancing and self quarantine, a well designed home has never been more important. The situations vary: working from home, juggling home school for multiple kids on multiple computers, video conference calls, online dance classes, etc. Regardless of the situation, the definition of Home is changing. At Studio Boise, designing for the way you truly live is at the heart of our mission, and the way you live is probably changing rapidly. In this blog post, our mission is to help you assess your changing needs and give you ideas that may help you work so well at home that you don’t want to go back to the office.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">First, compare your office work environment to spaces in your home.</blockquote>
                <p>Were you more productive at the office or not? Were you working in a space where interaction with coworkers kept you alert and happy to work? Were you in an office of complete silence and no visual or audio distractions? Consider too the comfort or discomfort of your work situation. Was your office kept at a colder temperature? Did your office smell a certain way? What amount of natural light did you have in your workspace? If you feel you were more productive in your old office than at home, chances are you will increase productivity by recreating a similar environment at home.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Timeless Design</h2>
                <p>At Studio Boise, I often here requests for a ‘timeless design,’ and what that usually means is a home designed so that it will never feel dated.  This is a tall order, but I have come to realize that there are two roads that lead to timeless design, and one road that leads away quickly.</p>
                <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/portfolio9.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                <!-- <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span> -->
                <p>There is, however, another avenue which is not for the faint of heart.  An absolutely unique design can also be timeless.  When a home cannot be identified as a known style, and the materials are equally unique or used in unorthodox ways, there is no date that can be attached to this new house design.</p>
